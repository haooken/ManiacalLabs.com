While we'd love for everyone who uses our code or hardware to send us an email and show off their projects, not everyone does. So we keep an eye on the internet for cool projects that use our products. Last night we were happy to find the project shown in the video above. The video description confirms they use [BiblioPixel](/BiblioPixel) and we're pretty sure they mentioned the [AllPixel](/AllPixel) as well. But even better, this thing looks so incredibly similar to [Colossus](/Colossus), just a little bit smaller. Same resolution, same basic construction, similar power routing... We put so much time into that project that it's just fantastic to see someone else build their own!

Great work guys! If you see this, please send more pictures and video! :)
