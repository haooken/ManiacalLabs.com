      <description>After a long week at the Day Job&amp;trade;, I sought the catharsis brought about by creativity and making something. To that end, I took stock of what parts I had lying around. I had been wanting to do something with a couple of TinyTim LED boardsÂ I&amp;rsquo;ve had from previous projects. These displays were sent to us by our good friends at WyoLum. I decided I wanted to mount the 4 panels I had loose and make a nice-looking All-In-One 8x32 display.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve shown off pre-production versions before, but our friends at WyoLum have just made the awesome TinyTiM available!
The TinyTiM, much like their larger TiM, is an awesome, well-made (by the same manufacturer as the AllPixel!), and versatile 8x8 LED matrix based on the WS2812 LED. And it&amp;rsquo;s 100% compatible with the AllPixel!
As usual, Justin from WyoLum is super awesome and sent us some early production boards&amp;hellip;
