      <description>Ever since working on the Adafruit APA102 Disk, it seemed the next logical step was to apply the same idea to a Christmas tree.

Green would just not do&amp;hellip; too dark for all the color :) It&amp;rsquo;s still way to early to put up the tree in my mind but, in the interest of beta testing, I figured I would give it a pass this year.</description>
