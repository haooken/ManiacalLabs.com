      <description>[landgrvi] has been posting in the Maniacal Labs forum about some awesome gazebo lighting he has been working on. He&amp;rsquo;s using the new LEDCircle class to run some really neat circular animations.
Check out this awesome small scale prototype!

      <description>Previously, I talked about the ODROID-C1 as a possible, faster alternative to the Raspberry Pi. Well, there&amp;rsquo;s a reason I haven&amp;rsquo;t mentioned it again&amp;hellip; the software is a mess. It just doesn&amp;rsquo;t have the community around it that the Pi does. Most disappointing was that their USB Serial kernel driver was a total mess and would not work with the AllPixel :( So, that&amp;rsquo;s why I&amp;rsquo;m so excited about the new Raspberry Pi 2!</description>
