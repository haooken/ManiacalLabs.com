      <title>PrismaChron Update</title>
      <link>https://ManiacalLabs.com/2013/11/27/prismachron-update/</link>

      <description>First of all, many thanks to those who supported our PrismaChron Tindie fundraiser!
Unfortunately, there wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough interest in this particular project to reach our funding goal. So we won&amp;rsquo;t, at this time, be making the PrismaChron, but it was not a worthless experience for us. We learned a great deal in the process.
While crowd-funding didn&amp;rsquo;t work out this time, we still see great potential in it, given the right product.</description>

      <description>First of all, many, many thanks to those who have supported the PrismaChron already! It’s been an interesting first week and we’re part of the way there, but we still have a ways to go.
Unfortunately, if we don’t hit the minimum number of pre-orders, we won’t be able to make the kits cost effective. So we are asking for a little more of your help.

      <title>Naming the PrismaChron</title>
      <link>https://ManiacalLabs.com/2013/11/14/naming-the-prismachron/</link>

      <description>Designing the PrismaChron was actually kind of easy compared to naming it. We went through a few:
 Rainbow Clock Color Clock ChromaChron ChronoChroma Color Time ChromataChron LumiChron HueTime ChronoChrome ColorChron ChronBow ChronoChromatic SpectraChron Spectrum Clock RGBTime Many more variations on this theme.  Many of them were ruled out pretty quickly with a quick web search. SpectraChron, for example was dangerously close to SpectraCron (no &amp;ldquo;h&amp;rdquo;) which was a trademarked brand of paint.</description>

      <title>Announcing the PrismaChron!</title>
      <link>https://ManiacalLabs.com/2013/11/11/announcing-the-prismachron/</link>

      <description>We are very happy to announce our latest kit, the PrismaChron!
  The PrismaChron Clock is our take on time as color. The display consists of three RGB LEDs, one each for seconds, minutes and hours. As each value progresses through time, its LED slowly fades through the spectrum from red to violet, and everywhere in between.
Just like the Binary Epoch Clock, the PrismaChron is fully Arduino compatible, open source, and ready to be hacked.</description>
