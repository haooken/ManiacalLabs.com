      <title>New Library: ESP Serial WiFi Manager</title>

      <description>The ESP8266 Arduino package provides a great and familiar to use ecosystem for developing code on the chip. However, most examples for WiFi network connection and management involve building and uploading new code every time you want to change the network settings. That&amp;rsquo;s just more than should be required if you want to simply connect an existing and complete project to a new network.
A forthcoming project in which we plan to use a large number of the Adafruit ESP8266 Feather boards for was going to be far to cumbersome to manage if we had to upload new code not only to change the WiFi network but to set static IPs.</description>

      <description>Git is awesome. It&amp;rsquo;s not just open source, but in the last few years, with the help of sites like GitHub, it has cemented itself as the source control software for open source. At Maniacal Labs we use it for everything and the same goes at my day job with Red Hat. At the latter, I&amp;rsquo;ve found myself having to use the &amp;ldquo;push &amp;ndash;force&amp;rdquo; option a lot recently due to some oddities with the way our code review process works (that&amp;rsquo;s a much longer post for another time) and of course the joke about it being a &amp;ldquo;force push&amp;rdquo;, as in Star Wars, came up a lot.</description>

      <description>So, last week, Adafruit launched this little beauty. Having just acquired a handful of Pi B+ and A+ boards and already having a 32x32 matrix that I&amp;rsquo;d been meaning to use, this was a complete insta-buyâ„¢. And, of course, I had to make it work with BiblioPixel! Well, it showed up last night and the coding commenced!
Fortunately, Adafruit already had a library ready to go with a handy python wrapper, since the main code is all C.</description>
