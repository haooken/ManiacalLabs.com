      <description>Yes, there is a virtual pinball table in existence at the Maniacal Labs Satellite Office (aka my house). More on this later, and in more detail! But for now, just a quick blurb on that project.
In short, the table consists of a TV on a 2x4 frame, raised and angled in such a way&amp;hellip;
You know a picture would be much better&amp;hellip;
The PC runs the software (Pinball FX 2 on Steam), and I&amp;rsquo;m pretty happy with the basic feel of it so far.</description>

      <description>As a lover of 3D printing, I of course, have a ton of filament for use with my Formbot T-Rex 2+. For reasons unknown to me, my office at home had a closet with a desk and power built into it. So way back when we got our MakerBot in 2013 it was quickly decided that it would be a great place for the printer. I&amp;rsquo;ve done a number of improvements over the years like sealing up the doors to make the whole thing a heated chamber (this works especially well with the Formbot&amp;rsquo;s 800W heated bed) and building some slide out shelves on the bottom.</description>
